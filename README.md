## Laky Phones Point Of Sales
This is a Point of Sales App. This project is my first app after diving deeper into python and with little knowledge of PySide. It has a robust, scalable, and powerful app with a modern design (Dracula theme). Built with python

### Features
- The dashboard is where daily activities are statistically displayed, user information, and stocks with a lesser quantity
- The sidebar can be expanded and collapsed. It contains the shortcut button to various interfaces, sign-out, and settings 
- The sales interface is the main interface where the sales activities happen. It has CRUD buttons, a table, and a print receipt button. - Item can be bought in bulk or in single
- The stock allows the user to keep track of individual items or goods from the supplier
